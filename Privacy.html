            <p>Discount Bee discounts are available on the Site, and app.</p>
            
            <p>The controller responsible for your personal data is The Beans Group.</p>

            <h3 id="do-you-share-my-data-with-any-other-organisations">Do you share my data with any other organisations?</h3>
            
            <p>We use your data to improve your experience. Our service means that we keep your personal data inside Discount Bee unless we are required by law to disclose your data or you ask us or give us your permission to share it, for example:</p>

For example to manage and service our data, distribute emails, research and analysis, manage brand and product promotions as well as administering certain services and features.</p>
            
            <p>We will only provide service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request, and we stipulate that they protect this information and do not use it for any other purpose. We take these relationships seriously and oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject.</p>
            
            <p>Please note that some of our service providers may be based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).  Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld.</p>
            
            <p>Please contact us if you want further information in relation to the transfer of your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
            
            <p>When we share your personal data outside Discount Bee we will:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Always share it in a secure way;</li>
              <li>Make sure it’s treated consistently with this Policy; and</li>
              <li>Not allow other companies to use it to contact you with their own marketing unless you give your permission.</li>

To provide you with a seamless experience, it may be necessary to share your personal data with third party partner websites you choose to use your Discount Bee login to access. We will only share what we need to in order to provide the service you are using and we will never routinely share all of the data we hold about you.</p>
            
            <p>Your Discount Bee account will always be covered by the policies of the Site.</p>
            
            <p>Where you opt in for marketing from brands you chose to take codes from, we will share your profile information with the third party including name, email address, university and date of birth.  The third party will become a Data Controller, distributing the marketing as governed by their privacy notice. Consent in relation to the third party data controller must be withdrawn directly with said third party. Erasure must also be sought direct with the third party.</p>
            
            <h5 id="links-to-third-party-websites">Links to third party websites</h5>

If you access third party websites using the links provided, the operators of these websites may collect information from you that could be used by them, in accordance with their own privacy policies.  Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
            
            <h3 id="your-rights">Your rights</h3>
            
            <p>As a data subject you have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. Below, we have described the various rights that you have, as well as how you can exercise them.</p>
            
            <h5 id="right-of-access">Right of Access</h5>
            
            <p>You may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (you may have heard of this right being described as a "<strong>subject access request</strong>").</p>
            
            <p>Please note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal data lawfully. It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to your personal data.</p>
            
            <p>You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using contact details set out here and telling us that you are making a subject access request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.</p>
            
            <h5 id="your-right-to-rectification-and-erasure">Your Right to Rectification and Erasure</h5>
            
            <p>You may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right described as the “<strong>right to be forgotten</strong>”).</p>
            
            <p>Please note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right. Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request.</p>
            
            <p>You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact details set out here and telling us that you are making a request to have your personal data rectified or erased and on what basis you are making that request. If you want us to replace inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us what that new data is. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.</p>
            
            <h5 id="your-right-to-restrict-processing">Your Right to Restrict Processing</h5>
            
            <p>Where we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest (see the section of this Policy which explains why we use your personal data) you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.</p>
            
            <p>You may also ask us to stop processing your personal data (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us verify that data's accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
            
            <p>Please note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it.</p>
            
            <p>You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact details set out here and telling us that you are making a request to have us stop processing the relevant aspect of your personal data and describing which of the above conditions you believe is relevant to that request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.</p>
            
            <h5 id="your-right-to-portability">Your Right to Portability</h5>
            
            <p>Where you wish to transfer certain personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means, to a third party you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.</p>
            
            <p>Because of the kind of work that we do and the systems that we use, we do not envisage this right being particularly relevant to the majority of individuals with whom we interact. However, if you wish to transfer your data from us to a third party we are happy to consider such requests.</p>
            
            <h5 id="your-right-to-stop-receiving-communications">Your Right to stop receiving communications</h5>
            
            <p>For details on your rights to ask us to stop sending you various kinds of communications, please contact us.</p>

            <p>You have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated decision making and profiling of your personal data, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing that affects you.</p>

            <h5 id="exercising-your-rights">Exercising your rights</h5>
            
            <p>When you write to us making a request to exercise your rights we are entitled to ask you to prove that you are who you say you are. We will require you to provide copies of two of the following ID documents to help us to verify your identity:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Passport.</li>
              <li>Driving licence.</li>
              <li>Student photo ID card.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>It will help us to process your request if you clearly state which right you wish to exercise and, where relevant, why it is that you are exercising it. The clearer and more specific you can be the faster and more efficiently we can deal with your request. If you do not provide us with sufficient information then we may delay actioning your request until you have provided us with additional information (and where this is the case we will tell you).</p>

            <p>1) What is a Cookie?</p>
            
            <p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone (all referred to here as a "<strong>device</strong>") web browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your web browser if your browser's preferences allow it. Many websites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. Similar technologies are also often used within emails to understand whether the email has been read or if any links have been clicked. If you continue without changing your settings, we’ll assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on the Site. However, you can change your cookie settings at any time.</p>
            
            <p>On the Site, cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor our websites to your interests.</p>
            
            <p>2) How does Discount Bee use cookies?</p>
            
            <p>Information supplied by cookies can help us to understand the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience.

            <p>It is important to note that if you change your settings and block certain cookies, you will not be able to take full advantage of some features of Discount Bee services, and we might not be able to provide some features you have previously chosen to receive.</p>
            
            <p>4) Other information collected from web browsers</p>
            
            <p>Your web browser may also provide Discount Bee with information about your device, such as an IP address and details about the browser that you are using. Where requesting local discounts, it may be possible for you to choose to provide Discount Bee with access to your device’s location through the web-browser. We use information provided by your browser or by the link that you have clicked to understand the webpage that directed you to Discount Bee and this may be captured by performance cookies.</p>
